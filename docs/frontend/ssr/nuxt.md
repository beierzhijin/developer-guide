# Nuxt

> Nuxt supports different rendering modes, [universal rendering](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/rendering#universal-rendering), [client-side rendering](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/rendering#client-side-rendering) but also offers [hybrid-rendering](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/rendering#hybrid-rendering) and the possibility to render your application on [CDN Edge Servers](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/rendering#edge-side-rendering).

> By default, Nuxt uses universal rendering to provide better user experience, performance and to optimize search engine indexing.

> Both the browser and server can interpret JavaScript code to turn Vue.js components into HTML elements. This step is called rendering.

生成HTML的过程就是 render

## [universal rendering](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/rendering#universal-rendering)

> the Client (browser) loads the JavaScript code that runs on the Server in the background once the HTML document has been downloaded

根据官方的解释，之所以叫做通用渲染（Universal Rendering）是因为客户端下载了服务端返回的整个html后，把本身已经在服务端跑过的js代码会在客户端再跑一遍

> Making a static page interactive in the browser is called "Hydration"

> Universal rendering allows a Nuxt application to provide quick page load times while preserving the benefits of client-side rendering. Furthermore, as the content is already present in the HTML document, crawlers can index it without overhead.

## What you can build with Nuxt?

+ Websites
+ Web Applications (SPAs)
+ Static Site Generation (SSG)

## [file-system routing](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/routing#pages)

通过F12 devtools的观察，初始页面`pages`-`index.vue`在服务端渲染后，客户端的vue-router就会开始takeover了，后续的路由切换都基于客户端浏览器了

## ContentDoc

*以下内容由 Nuxt 官网的 `Ask AI`[^1] 生成 --*

The `<ContentDoc>` component is a powerful feature in Nuxt Content that allows you to easily fetch and render content documents. Here's a brief overview of its key aspects:

1. Purpose: It's designed to query and display a single document from your content directory [Components](https://content.nuxt.com/components/content-doc/).

2. Default behavior: If no path is specified, it uses `$route.path` to fetch the corresponding document [Usage Part 1](https://content.nuxt.com/usage/render/).

3. Usage: You can use it in a catch-all route to render content pages. Here's a basic example:

```vue
<template>
  <main>
    <ContentDoc />
  </main>
</template>
```
[Get-started > Render pages](https://content.nuxt.com/get-started/installation/#render-pages)

4. Props: It accepts several props, including `tag`, `path`, `excerpt`, `query`, and `head` [Components](https://content.nuxt.com/components/content-doc/).

5. Slots: It provides slots for customization, including `default`, `not-found`, and `empty` [Components](https://content.nuxt.com/components/content-doc/).

6. Head management: By default, it handles head management using `useContentHead()` [Components](https://content.nuxt.com/components/content-doc/).

7. Underlying components: It uses `<ContentRenderer>` and `<ContentQuery>` under the hood [Components](https://content.nuxt.com/components/content-doc/).

`<ContentDoc>` is a convenient way to render your content, especially when your route path matches your content file structure. It simplifies the process of fetching and displaying content in your Nuxt application.

## bug

实测，vscode 插件 `Astro v2.14.0` 开启时，会导致 nuxt 项目中的组件高亮、ts检查等功能混乱失效，可以在开发nuxt项目时先disable掉Astro插件
